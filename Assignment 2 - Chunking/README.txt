- To run the various shallow parsers, please (preferably) upload the notebooks to kaggle. 

BiLSTM
- For LSTM please change the accelarator to TPU (training would take 1-2 minutes with TPU).
- Preferable to run the code on kaggle as it already has all the packages compatible with the notebook.
- Running all the cells in the notebook will plot all the graphs like confusion matrix, classification report and tag scores.
- the conll data is already present on kaggle as well as the GloVe embeddings which can be readily attached to the notebook.

CRF
- For CRF, CPU is sufficient.
- Preferable to run the code on kaggle as it already has all the packages compatible with the notebook.
- Running all the cells in the notebook will plot all the graphs like confusion matrix, classification report and tag scores.

MEMM
- For MEMM please change the accelerator to TPU (takes a few minutes)
- Running all the cells in the notebook will plot all the graphs like confusion matrix, classification report and tag scores.
- Preferable to run the code on kaggle as it already has all the packages compatible with the notebook.
- The CONLL data and the GloVe Embeddings are already present on kaggle which can be attached
