- To run the various POS taggers, please upload the notebooks to kaggle. 


- For LSTM please change the accelarator to TPU.
- Preferable to run the code on kaggle as it already has all the packages compatible with the notebook.
- Running all the cells in the notebook will plot all the graphs like confusion matrix, classification report and tag scores.


- For HMM, CPU is sufficient.
- Preferable to run the code on kaggle as it already has all the packages compatible with the notebook.
- Running all the cells in the notebook will plot all the graphs like confusion matrix, classification report and tag scores.


- The complete code for SVM resides in the 'SVM_POS_tagger.ipynb' jupyter notebook.
- Running all the cells in the notebook will plot all the graphs like confusion matrix, classification report and tag scores.
- Preferable to run the code on kaggle as it already has all the packages compatible with the notebook.
- The notebook has no external dependencies except the python modules imported inside the code itself.
